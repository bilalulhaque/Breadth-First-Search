# Breadth-First-Search
BFS is a traversal method that requires you to begin traversing from a certain node (the source or starting node) and travel the graph layer by layer, thereby exploring the neighbor nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). Then you must go to the next-level neighbor nodes.
